# Current State

Status date: 2026-08-08.

This document is intentionally limited to implemented behavior and current limitations.

The larger cognitive model and future agency architecture are described in `MIND_MODEL.md`.
The current M4 implementation is the process-isolated substrate of that model; it does not yet
contain the planned M8 language faculty or M9 authorized executor.

## Process topology

After M4, Mind has seven real user-session processes:

```text
cybou-eventd
cybou-identityd
cybou-intentiond
cybou-predictord
cybou-selfd
cybou-workspaced
cybou-presenced
```

`plasmashell` no longer constructs Identity, Intentions, Predictor, SelfModel, Workspace, Journal,
or EventClient. It loads a lightweight `Presence` QObject whose runtime job is Presence1 IPC and
QML property caching.

## Ownership

| Resource / responsibility | Owner |
|---|---|
| `journal.db` | `cybou-eventd` |
| `identity.json` | `cybou-identityd` |
| identity login marker | `cybou-identityd` under `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/cybou` |
| intention commands/projection | `cybou-intentiond` |
| prediction/calibration | `cybou-predictord` |
| self projection/assessment | `cybou-selfd` |
| bounded attention | `cybou-workspaced` |
| presentation aggregation | `cybou-presenced` |
| visual cache | Plasma Presence proxy |

There is currently no language-model process and no privileged action-executor process in this
ownership table.

## IPC

Versioned Qt D-Bus interfaces:

```text
org.cybou.Mind.Event1
org.cybou.Mind.Identity1
org.cybou.Mind.Intention1
org.cybou.Mind.Predictor1
org.cybou.Mind.Self1
org.cybou.Mind.Workspace1
org.cybou.Mind.Presence1
```

Complex organ projections use fabric CBOR version 1. Event1 CognitiveEnvelope encoding remains
separate from generic projection encoding and from canonical Journal hashing.

## Lifecycle

The NixOS module installs each organ as a `systemd --user` `Type=dbus` service. The services are
D-Bus activated.

They are intentionally not eagerly wanted by the graphical target: the Plasma-hosted proxy first
performs the one-time pre-M1 state-location migration, then its first Presence1 request can
activate the Mind graph.

Identity uses a volatile runtime-session marker. Restarting `identityd` inside the same user login
reloads the current identity without incrementing `sessionCount`.

This is a restart guard, not the full M5/M6 continuity proof.

## Durable-to-visible ordering

```text
command
→ owning organ process
→ Event1
→ eventd
→ Journal COMMIT
→ Event1 Accepted
→ workspaced admission
→ Workspace1 Changed
→ presenced Changed
→ QML proxy refresh
```

This is the implemented form of the `durable before visible` invariant.

## Current cognitive substrate

The present tree has implementation boundaries for:

- canonical durable causal history;
- identity ownership;
- intention state;
- prediction/calibration state;
- self projection/assessment;
- bounded Workspace attention;
- presentation aggregation;
- process-level health/failure isolation.

These components are intentionally useful without any language model.

## Not implemented yet

The current tree does **not** yet implement:

- full M5 restart/reboot/upgrade continuity proof and reconciliation;
- M6 explicit degraded-Mind capability-deficit policy;
- M7 inter-node transport, replication, or partition handling;
- M8 optional language faculty;
- M9 planning/authorization/executor pipeline for privileged external actions.

A UI or current organ method should not be described as providing those future capabilities unless
the corresponding milestone is implemented and gated.

## Current limitations

- health is a minimal `Ready()/Health()` contract, not the full M6 degraded-mode model;
- most local RPC is synchronous;
- same-user IPC authorization is not yet a capability security boundary;
- stronger restart/reconciliation guarantees belong to M5/M6;
- no inter-node transport exists;
- no model-selection/context policy for M8 exists;
- no authorization policy or typed privileged executor for M9 exists.

## Milestones

- M1: complete.
- M2: complete.
- M3: complete after the M3 compile repair included by M4.
- M4: implementation present; repository gates remain the acceptance authority.
- M5: next.

See `ROADMAP.md` for the capability meaning of M5–M9.
