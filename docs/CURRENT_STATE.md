# Current State

Status date: 2026-08-07.

## Process topology

After M4, Mind has seven real user-session processes:

```text
cybou-eventd
cybou-identityd
cybou-intentiond
cybou-predictord
cybou-selfd
cybou-workspaced
cybou-presenced
```

`plasmashell` no longer constructs Identity, Intentions, Predictor, SelfModel, Workspace, Journal,
or EventClient. It loads a lightweight `Presence` QObject whose runtime job is Presence1 IPC and
QML property caching.

## Ownership

| Resource / responsibility | Owner |
|---|---|
| `journal.db` | `cybou-eventd` |
| `identity.json` | `cybou-identityd` |
| identity login marker | `cybou-identityd` under `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/cybou` |
| intention commands/projection | `cybou-intentiond` |
| prediction/calibration | `cybou-predictord` |
| self projection/assessment | `cybou-selfd` |
| bounded attention | `cybou-workspaced` |
| presentation aggregation | `cybou-presenced` |
| visual cache | Plasma Presence proxy |

## IPC

Versioned Qt D-Bus interfaces:

```text
org.cybou.Mind.Event1
org.cybou.Mind.Identity1
org.cybou.Mind.Intention1
org.cybou.Mind.Predictor1
org.cybou.Mind.Self1
org.cybou.Mind.Workspace1
org.cybou.Mind.Presence1
```

Complex organ projections use fabric CBOR version 1. Event1 CognitiveEnvelope encoding remains
separate from generic projection encoding and from canonical Journal hashing.

## Lifecycle

The NixOS module installs each organ as a `systemd --user` `Type=dbus` service. The services are
D-Bus activated.

They are intentionally not eagerly wanted by the graphical target: the Plasma-hosted proxy first
performs the one-time pre-M1 state-location migration, then its first Presence1 request can
activate the Mind graph.

Identity uses a volatile runtime-session marker. Restarting `identityd` inside the same user login
reloads the current identity without incrementing `sessionCount`.

## Durable-to-visible ordering

```text
command
→ owning organ process
→ Event1
→ eventd
→ Journal COMMIT
→ Event1 Accepted
→ workspaced admission
→ Workspace1 Changed
→ presenced Changed
→ QML proxy refresh
```

## Current limitations

- health is a minimal `Ready()/Health()` contract, not the full M6 degraded-mode model;
- most local RPC is synchronous;
- same-user IPC authorization is not yet a capability security boundary;
- stronger restart/reconciliation guarantees belong to M5/M6;
- no inter-node transport exists.

## Milestones

- M1: complete.
- M2: complete.
- M3: complete after the M3 compile repair included by M4.
- M4: complete after process-integration and VM gates pass.
- M5: next.
